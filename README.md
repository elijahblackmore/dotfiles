These are my personal configuration files for various applications on macOS.

- [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) — Vim-like modal text editor that I **really love**.
-  [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) — The command-line shell that I use, paired with [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) for better directory jumping.
-  [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) — An **amazing** customizable shell prompt that supports fish.
-  [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) — Terminal emulator.

>  [!NOTE]
> I would like to properly experiment with [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) to declaratively configure my system, but it does have a steep learning curve.

> For now I am using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install packages. [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is used to manage this repository via symlinks.
